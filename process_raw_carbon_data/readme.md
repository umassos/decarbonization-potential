## Process Downloaded Carbon Data 


1. Make sure that the downloaded 'hourly' carbon data files from the Electricity Maps are in [downloaded_carbon_data](../downloaded_carbon_data) directory. Note that the hourly data files would be in the ```<zone code>_<year>_hourly.csv``` format.

2. Make sure that all the zone codes have the same number of files (i.e., from 2021-2023)
